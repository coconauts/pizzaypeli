- mark as seen shortcut with today's date
- order by different filters (votes, last/first added, score...)
- dockerize 
- use a component library rather than custom css (eg, tailwind)
- more metadata:
    - parental info
    - score
    - external links (eg, imdb,  justwatch, commonsensemedia... )
    - trailer
    - check a movie in radarr as an example
- consider an alternative metadata source. Eg: https://www.thetvdb.com/ or https://www.themoviedb.org/
- imdbinfo library needs frequent updating, since it relies on scraping. Consider a script for atomated updating in production (detecting new versions and forcing a rebuild). Or perhaps just forcing a rebuild periodically regardless.
